inspect element to see code
icon in top left to mouse over and see code of specific area
highlight text and images to see text size and font
sources > images to find images
nav bar arrows > application > frames tab is another much easier way
when an image is open, click the three dots next to the closing button and move the doc to the bottom using the icons to see the image's size
